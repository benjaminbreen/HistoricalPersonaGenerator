/**
 * types/generation/noise.ts - Specific types for noise generation utilities
 *
 * This file is currently a placeholder as per the modularization plan.
 * The `ValueNoise` class itself is located in `utils/noise.ts`.
 * If specific interfaces or types related to noise generation are needed,
 * they can be defined here. For example:
 *
 * export interface NoiseGenerator {
 *   noise(x: number, y: number): number;
 *   octaveNoise(x: number, y: number, octaves: number, persistence: number, lacunarity: number): number;
 * }
